# OrbitReport

### LaunchCode Assignment

### What I need to do
- Fetch satellite data from a server, and use the returned data to poplate a list in the view.
- In all the returned data, if a satellite`s type is space debris, give that <td> element a red color using class binding.
- Give orbit-count component the necessary property binding so it can display the number of different types of satellite in its UI.
- Add Zebra Stripes styling to the list in orbit-list component, using class binding base on the current index of the item in the statllite array.
- Fix  the search function so it can work properly.
